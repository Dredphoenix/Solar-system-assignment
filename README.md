# 🌌 3D Solar System – Vishwa R.

This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system built using **Three.js** and **vanilla JavaScript**. It showcases all 8 planets orbiting around the Sun with adjustable speed controls for each planet.

## 🚀 Features

- ☀️ Sun at the center of the scene
- 🪐 All 8 planets (Mercury to Neptune) orbiting in 3D space
- 🎛️ Speed control sliders for real-time orbit adjustment
- 🔄 Smooth orbit animations using `requestAnimationFrame`
- 💡 Realistic lighting and 3D perspective
- 📱 Fully mobile-responsive and browser-compatible

## 🧠 How It Works

- The scene is built using `Three.js`, rendering to a full-screen `<canvas>`.
- Each planet is created as a 3D sphere with its own orbit radius and speed.
- Planets revolve around the Sun using trigonometric circular motion.
- Sliders in the UI panel control the speed of each individual planet in real time.

## 🧪 How to Run It

1. **Download or unzip** the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Adjust the sliders to change orbit speeds of planets live.

> No installations or build tools needed.
